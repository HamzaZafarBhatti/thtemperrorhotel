                                <p>The Board of KYM has adopted this Board Charter, which applies to all members of the Board and executive officers/senior management of the Company.</p>

                                <p><b>2.1</b> <span class="underline">Composition of the Board</span></p>
                                <p>The size of the Board is determined in accordance with the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association. At any one time, at least one-third (1/3) of the Board members are independent directors. The Board must comprise a majority of independent directors where the chairman of the Company is not an independent director.</p>
                                <p>The members of the Board will have an appropriate and broad range of qualifications and expertise.</p>

                                <p>The composition and size of the Board are reviewed from time to time to ensure its appropriateness. </p>
                                <p><b>2.2</b> <span class="underline">Appointments And Re-Election</span></p>
                                <p>The Nomination &amp; Remuneration Committee is responsible for assessing the required mix of skills, experience and specializations of the candidates which director should bring to the Board before recommending to the Board for appointment. The Nomination &amp; Remuneration Committee also assesses the board effectiveness, the contribution and commitment of the each Director annually.</p>
                                <p>The Company's Articles of Association provides that at least one third of the Directors retire by rotation at each Annual General Meeting and all directors retire from office once at least every three (3) years and shall be eligible for re-election. The Managing Director shall also retire once in every three (3) years subject to re-election and re-appointment.</p>
                                <p>Director who attains the age over 70 shall retire at every Annual General Meeting in accordance with Section 129(6) of the Companies Act, 1965 and may offer themselves for re-appointment to hold office until the next annual general meeting. </p>

Subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders being obtained, the Board may recommend and justify in the event it retains an independent director who has served a cumulative term of 9 years as an independent director of the Company.</p>

                                <p>The Board Committees shall operate within clearly defined terms of references. The Board may establish additional committees to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. The Board may also delegate specified responsibilities to ad hoc committees from time to time. The Chairman of the respective Committees reports to the Board on the key matters deliberated at their respective meetings and their recommendation thereon. Such reports or minutes will be included in the Board papers.</p>
                                <p>Directors must be satisfied that the members of the Board Committees are competent and reliable and will exercise their delegated functions in accordance with Directors' duties. Membership and performance of Board Committees is assessed at least once every year by those committees and the Board.</p>

                                <p>All Directors will be provided with the performance and progress reports on a timely basis prior to the scheduled Board meetings. A full agenda of the meeting and all Board papers, including complicated issues or specific matters, would be distributed in advance to ensure Directors are well informed and have the opportunity to seek additional information, and are able to obtain further clarification from the Company Secretary, should such a need arise. Where necessary, the services of other senior management or external consultants will be arranged to brief and help the Directors clear any doubt or concern.</p>
                                <p>Where a Director is directly or indirectly interested in any transaction entered into by the Company, he has a duty to make an immediate declaration to the Board and he is required to abstain from deliberations and decisions of the Board on the transaction.</p>

                                <p>All Directors, whether as a Board or in their individual capacity have full access to the Senior Management and advice of Company Secretary in relation to the information within the Group and to obtain independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties at the expense of the Company/Group, if required, so as to ensure the Directors are able to make independent and informed decisions.</p>
                                <p>If a director considers that professional advice is necessary, the director shall first obtain the approval of the Board. In the event that one or more directors seek to appoint one or more advisors, the Chairman should take steps to facilitate discussions to arrive at a consensus.
